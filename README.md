## mmCIF Dictionary Site Generator

### Introduction

This module contains a collection of utility classes used to generate
marked-u content for the [mmCIF Resource Site](mmcif.wwpdb.org)

### Installation

Download the library source software from the project repository:

```bash

git clone  https://github.com/rcsb/py-mmcif_sitegen.git

```

This is preliminary port which continues to use test examples to
to generate site HTML and image content.   This is working
with new Python framework (Python versions 2.7 or 3.6) but
is lacking a proper CLI to control an configure general operations.

Note: The newer Python 3x parser will report issues with non-ascii characters
in dictionary content.
